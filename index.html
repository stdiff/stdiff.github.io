              I have a passion for advanced analysis and DataOps. 
              Applying advanced analysis methods, we can gain deep insights in a data.
              Applying DataOps methods, we can convert the gained insights into business values in a scalable fashion.
              I look at these two fields as a connected large field and propose an end-to-end solution for a data product.
            </p>
            <p>
              My former profession was a researcher. After I received my PhD in Mathematics in 2009, 
              I researched mathematics as a researcher in Taiwan (NCKU) and Germany (MPIM and Uni Muenster). 
              After that I chose a career in data science, because I can apply my expertise, Mathematics,
              to a real problem in data science and I like coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently working as a Data Engineer/Machine Learning Engineer at

          <div class="post-description">
            <p>
              Because I have experience in front-end (analysis, modeling, reporting) and 
              back-end (data engineering, software development) in data science,
              I describe myself as a <strong>full stack data scientist</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="post-section">Advanced analysis</h3>
            <p>
              I do descriptive analysis, which is the most important type of analysis. 
              But beyond that I tackle a complicated problem which we need statistical method, 
              machine learning or deep learning.

              My main programming language is <strong>Python</strong>, 
              but I have a hands-on experience in <strong>R</strong>, as well.
              I use <strong>scikit-learn</strong> and <strong>pandas</strong> for my daily business.
              I also create a model with <strong>TensorFlow</strong> especially in an <strong>NLP</strong> project.
              My favorite visualization library is <strong>Altair</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="post-section">Big Data</h3>

            <p>
              An <strong>RDBMS</strong> is a comfortable data storage for me, 
              but <strong>Spark</strong> cluster is one of my favorite environments, 
              because it allows me to do a complicated analysis of big data.
              For data processing I use <strong>PySpark</strong> as well as Spark with <strong>Scala</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="post-section">DataOps</h3>

            <p>
              DataOps is DevOps for data science, namely a set of practices that combines data science and IT operations.
              DataOps is a key concept for an effective and efficient data science project.

              <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>CI/CD pipeline</strong> (Jenkins, TravisCI)
              are of course in my DataOps toolbox.

              I also have a hands-on experience in <strong>AWS</strong>.
              My favorite AWS tools are Lambda, S3, ECS/ECR and CodeBuild.
